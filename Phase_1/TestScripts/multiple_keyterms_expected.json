PulseNet is the national subtyping network of public health and food regulatory agency laboratories coordinated by CDC. DNA fingerprinting was performed on Listeria bacteria isolated from ill people by using a standardized laboratory and data analysis method called whole genome sequencing (WGS). CDC PulseNet manages a national database of these sequences that are used to identify possible outbreaks. WGS gives investigators detailed information about the bacteria causing illness. In this investigation, WGS showed that bacteria isolated from ill people were closely related genetically. This means that people in this outbreak were more likely to share a common source of infection.","reports":{"diseases":["listeriosis"],"event_date":"2021-01-26 xx:xx:xx","locations":["Florida","Louisiana","Massachusetts","New York"],"syndromes":[]},"url":"https://www.cdc.gov/listeria/outbreaks/delimeat-10-20/index.html"}],"log":{"access_time":"2022-03-18 03:25:23","data_source":"CDC Current Outbreak List","team_name":"Thumbnails"}}
