All six ill persons who could provide information about packaging of cheeses reported consuming cheese that had been cut and repackaged at a retail location. The investigation is complex because ill persons reported consuming many different cheeses from many different retail locations. No one cheese was reported by the majority of ill persons, suggesting that cross-contamination of other cheeses through cutting boards and utensils may have played a role. The investigation focused on identifying intact cheeses shipped to multiple retail locations where ill persons purchased cut and repackaged cheese.","reports":{"diseases":["listeriosis"],"event_date":"2012-11-21 14:30:xx","locations":["California","Colorado","District of Columbia","Maryland","Massachusetts","Minnesota","Nebraska","New Jersey","New Mexico","New York","Ohio","Pennsylvania","Virginia","Washington"],"syndromes":[]},"url":"https://www.cdc.gov/listeria/outbreaks/cheese-09-12/index.html"},{"date_of_publication":"2012-08-27 10:30:xx","headline":"Multistate Outbreak of Listeriosis Linked to Whole Cantaloupes from Jensen Farms, Colorado ","main_text":"Among persons for whom information was available, reported illness onset ranged from July 31, 2011 through October 27, 2011.
